SGD_all_ORFs_5prime_UTRs.READMEInformation about the SGD_all_ORFs_5prime_UTRs.fsa file.This file contains sequences for predicted 5Õ UTR sequences for all characterized, uncharacterized and dubious ORFs in S288c.Coordinates from both the longest transcripts covering an ORF in yeast grown in YPD or GAL (S288C transcriptome set derived from Pelechano et al, PMID:23615609) and all ORFs were used to determine the 5Õ UTR coordinates.A BED file with these coordinates was made. Sequences were batch downloaded in FASTA format from USCS GenomeTable Browser on 03-09-2021 (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=604915183_aUc9FZ1vwyAccGti1uI0wteYEM7x)file created: 2017-08-25last modified: 2021-03-10
