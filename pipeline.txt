1. import database of clean RS (clean means longer than 5 and palindoroms, containing only ATGC)
2. import n (X>2n), alpha params, and gene +- 1000 string

3. starting from the desired end of the gene and direction, excluding the first n basepairs (bp) 
    find first clean cut site (CS), meaning same code as one of RS (separate function)
4. Merge X (n+len(RS)+CS offset, without STOP codon) with linker, FPG, alphaX
5. Check for uniqueness of CS from 3. in sequence from 4.
6. If not 5. repeat 3. starting from the last CS
7. Search for the most outer CS from MCS that are not in 4. 
    (two independent searches, one from left, one from right. Maybe function from 3. can be used)
    7a. If impossible to find, exit
8. Assemble the final plasmid without MCS part that is replaced with sequence from 4.
9. Check for uniqueness of CS from 3. in sequence the final plasmid
10. If not 9. repeat 3. starting from the last CS
