min_homology = 70
RS0 is HindIII 
XhoI (equally good as AbsI) and SacI can be used for cutting MCS

min_homology = 80 max_homology = 500 alpha = 1.5
RS0 is XbaI 
XhoI (equally good as AbsI) and SacI can be used for cutting MCS
plasmids assembled for this case


min_homology = 100 and max_homology = 500
no good cutsite
